 * The fixed bounds every Database Advisor scan runs under, so an on-demand scan against a very large or very
 * slow schema can never turn into unbounded work on the request thread.
 *
 * <p>Row bounds are enforced by reading one row past the limit ({@code max + 1}), which makes truncation
 * deterministic and observable rather than silently returning a full-looking result. The wall-clock budget
 * stops the scan between units of work, and {@link #statementTimeout()} is applied to every vendor catalog
 * statement through {@code Statement.setQueryTimeout} so a blocked catalog query cannot outlive it.</p>
