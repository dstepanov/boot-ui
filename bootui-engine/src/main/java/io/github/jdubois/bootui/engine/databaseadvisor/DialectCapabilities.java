/**
 * What one datasource's catalog can answer, derived from its {@link Dialect} and {@link DatabaseVersion}.
 *
 * <p>Every capability gates a catalog column or view that simply does not exist on older servers, so the
 * introspector can select the right SQL up front instead of discovering the gap through a failed query —
 * and can report an honest "not supported by this server version" reason when a rule's data is missing,
 * rather than silently reporting no findings.</p>
 *
 * @param indexIncludeColumns whether {@code pg_index.indnkeyatts} is available (PostgreSQL 11+) to tell a
 *     covering index's true key columns from its {@code INCLUDE} (non-key) columns — {@code getIndexInfo()}
 *     reports both as if they were ordinary key parts
 * @param nullsNotDistinct whether {@code pg_index.indnullsnotdistinct} is available (PostgreSQL 15+) to tell
 *     a unique index that treats {@code NULL} as distinct (the default, so several {@code NULL}s are allowed)
 *     from one declared {@code NULLS NOT DISTINCT}
 * @param indexBuildProgressView whether {@code pg_stat_progress_create_index} is available (PostgreSQL 12+)
 *     to tell an index that is merely still being built {@code CONCURRENTLY} (transiently invalid) from one
 *     genuinely left behind by a failed build
 * @param oracleCatalog whether the confirmed Oracle server is new enough (19c+) for this advisor's {@code
 *     ALL_*}/{@code SYS_CONTEXT} catalog augmentation, which is written and verified against 19c+ only
